# mine-sweeper

Hi, welcome to my version of Minesweeper!

The rules of the game go like this:

1) The game starts with a grid of which the size differs
   depending on which difficulty you choose.

2) For every 4 grid blocks generated, there is atleast 
   1 gaurnateed block with a mine in it. The mines are 
   dispersed randomly in no particular order.

3) Your job as the protagonist ("The Minesweeper") is to
   click on every block that does not possess a mine, if you
   manage to do that then you win the game! Simple right!?

4) You can right click on a block to flag it. This can be useful
   as it may help to mark areas where potential mines are.

5) The most important rule: DONT GET BLOWN UP!!! :)


HOW TO INSTALL:

1) Download the minesweeper app and place it wherever you want 
   on your trusty PC

2) Run "npm install" in the command terminal 

3) Once all react packages are installed run the command "npm start"

4) Enjoy the game!
